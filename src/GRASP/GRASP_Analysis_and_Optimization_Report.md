  - Constraint satisfaction
  - Iterations per run
  - Time vs iterations relationship
  - Early vs late convergence

## Code Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Performance Optimizations

#### a) Caching and Memoization
```matlab
% In greedyRandomized.m, line 33:
% Currently evaluates PerfSNS for each candidate in each iteration
% Optimization: Cache previously computed distances

% Add persistent cache at function start
persistent distanceCache;
if isempty(distanceCache)
    distanceCache = containers.Map();
end

% Use cache for repeated evaluations
cacheKey = mat2str(sort(tempSolution));
if isKey(distanceCache, cacheKey)
    [avgSP, maxSP] = distanceCache(cacheKey);
else
    [avgSP, maxSP] = PerfSNS(G, tempSolution);
    distanceCache(cacheKey) = [avgSP, maxSP];
end
```

#### b) Vectorized Operations
```matlab
% In steepestAscentHillClimbing.m, lines 26-45:
% Currently uses nested loops for neighbor generation
% Optimization: Pre-compute all neighbors and evaluate in parallel

% Generate all possible swaps at once
[selectedIdx, notSelectedIdx] = meshgrid(1:length(bestSolution), 1:length(notSelected));
swapPairs = [selectedIdx(:), notSelectedIdx(:)];

% Evaluate neighbors in batches
neighbors = repmat(bestSolution, size(swapPairs, 1), 1);
for i = 1:size(swapPairs, 1)
    neighbors(i, swapPairs(i, 1)) = notSelected(swapPairs(i, 2));
end

% Parallel evaluation if Parallel Computing Toolbox available
if exist('parfor', 'builtin')
    parfor i = 1:size(neighbors, 1)
        [avgSPs(i), maxSPs(i)] = PerfSNS(G, neighbors(i, :));
    end
end
```

#### c) Early Termination
```matlab
% In GRASP.m, add stagnation detection:
stagnationCounter = 0;
stagnationLimit = 20; % No improvement for 20 iterations

% Inside main loop (after line 55):
if avgSP < bestAvgSP && maxSP <= Cmax
    stagnationCounter = 0;  % Reset counter
    % ... existing code ...
else
    stagnationCounter = stagnationCounter + 1;
    if stagnationCounter >= stagnationLimit
        fprintf('Early termination due to stagnation at iteration %d\n', iteration);
        break;
    end
end
```

### 2. Memory Optimizations

#### a) Sparse Data Structures
```matlab
% If the graph is sparse, ensure using sparse matrices
if ~issparse(G.Edges.Weight)
    G = graph(G.Edges.EndNodes(:,1), G.Edges.EndNodes(:,2), ...
              sparse(G.Edges.Weight), G.Nodes);
end
```

#### b) Result Storage Optimization
```matlab
% Pre-allocate results arrays with estimated size
estimatedIterations = floor(maxTime * 2); % Based on average iteration time
results.avgSPs = zeros(1, estimatedIterations);
results.maxSPs = zeros(1, estimatedIterations);
results.times = zeros(1, estimatedIterations);
results.iterations = zeros(1, estimatedIterations);
resultsIdx = 0;

% Trim arrays at the end
results.avgSPs = results.avgSPs(1:resultsIdx);
```

## Missing Analyses Compared to GA

### 1. Population Diversity Analysis
GA tracks fitness distribution across population. GRASP could track:
- Solution diversity metrics
- Repeated solution detection
- Construction phase randomness effectiveness

### 2. Multi-Objective Tracking
GA evaluates multiple objectives. GRASP could add:
- Pareto frontier tracking when considering avgSP vs maxSP
- Trade-off analysis between objectives

### 3. Component Analysis
Track which nodes appear most frequently in good solutions:
```matlab
% Add to GRASP.m results tracking
nodeFrequency = zeros(1, nNodes);
if avgSP < bestAvgSP * 1.1  % Track near-optimal solutions
    nodeFrequency(solution) = nodeFrequency(solution) + 1;
end
```

## Additional Plots and Metrics to Implement

### 1. Solution Space Exploration Visualization
```matlab
function plotSolutionSpaceExploration(allResults)
    % 3D scatter plot: iteration, avgSP, maxSP
    % Color-coded by solution quality
    % Shows exploration vs exploitation behavior
end
```

### 2. Construction vs Improvement Analysis
```matlab
function plotPhaseContribution(results)
    % Compare initial solution quality vs final quality
    % Quantify improvement from local search phase
    % Identify when construction phase produces near-optimal solutions
end
```

### 3. Parameter Sensitivity Heat Map
```matlab
function plotParameterHeatMap(G, n, Cmax)
    % Test grid of parameters: r values vs time limits
    % Create heat map of solution quality
    % Identify sweet spots for parameter settings
end
```

### 4. Robustness Analysis
```matlab
function analyzeRobustness(allResults)
    % Coefficient of variation across runs
    % Worst-case performance analysis
    % Probability of finding high-quality solutions
end
```

### 5. Comparative Analysis Dashboard
```matlab
function createComparativeDashboard(graspResults, gaResults)
    % Side-by-side comparison of:
    % - Convergence speed
    % - Solution quality distribution
    % - Computational efficiency (quality vs time)
    % - Robustness metrics
end
```

## Implementation Priority Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Caching mechanism** - Significant performance improvement
2. **Early termination** - Saves computation time
3. **Construction vs Improvement analysis** - Key GRASP insight
4. **Node frequency tracking** - Valuable for understanding solution structure

### Medium Priority
1. **Vectorized operations** - Performance gain depends on problem size
2. **Parameter sensitivity heat map** - Useful for fine-tuning
3. **Solution diversity metrics** - Helps understand algorithm behavior

### Low Priority
1. **3D solution space visualization** - Nice to have for presentation
2. **Sparse matrix optimization** - Only if graphs are very large
3. **Parallel evaluation** - Requires additional toolbox

## Missing Functionality Compared to GA

### 1. Population-based Metrics
GA has population size, GRASP could track:
- Solution pool diversity over time
- Frequency of solution revisits

### 2. Evolutionary Operators Analysis
GA tracks mutation/crossover effects, GRASP could track:

- Neighborhood size impact

### 3. Detailed Convergence Analysis
GA tracks generation-wise progress, GRASP could add:

- Quality improvement per phase
- Restart effectiveness (if implemented)

## Conclusion

1. Performance improvements through caching and early termination
2. Additional analyses to understand algorithm behavior better
3. Comparative visualizations with GA results
